# Why this project?
In an effort to determine the social services that are urgently needed for Hurula Youth and Women,
UN Women carried out research to assess the relationship between social services provision and
poor health infrastructure which is exacerbating high maternal mortality rate in Hurula.

# The Problem

# The Solution
one of the strategies adopted by the UN Women Hurula country office is to address
healthcare infrastructure and accessibility challenges through Health on Wheels (a mobile clinic).
This is a well-furnished mobile clinic that offers maternal clinical health services, counselling,
consultations, training the trainers, and provision of health materials such as sanitary towels
services in marginalized communities (remote and rural areas) in Hurula.
